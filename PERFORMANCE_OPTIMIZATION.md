# Performance Optimization Strategy

## Current Bottlenecks Identified

### 1. ResourceOverview.tsx (1865 lines)
- **No debouncing on filter inputs** - Every keystroke triggers full re-render
- **No pagination** - Rendering ALL resources (could be 1000+)
- **No memoization** - Expensive calculations run on every render
- **Inline filtering** - Filters recalculated on every render

### 2. ProjectManagement.tsx (7386 lines)
- **Massive file size** indicates complexity issues
- Likely has similar filtering/rendering issues
- Needs analysis and optimization

### 3. Common Issues Across Pages
- Sequential API calls instead of parallel
- No caching of API responses
- Large datasets rendered without virtualization
- Missing React.memo on components
- Missing useMemo/useCallback optimizations

## Optimization Techniques Applied

### Phase 1: Utility Hooks (COMPLETED)
✅ Created `useDebounce.ts` - Debounce filter inputs (500ms default)
✅ Created `usePagination.ts` - Client-side pagination
✅ Created `Pagination.tsx` - Reusable pagination component

### Phase 2: ResourceOverview Optimization (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Add debouncing to filter inputs
- [ ] Implement pagination (50 items per page)
- [ ] Memoize filtered results with useMemo
- [ ] Memoize expensive functions (formatCurrency, getUtilizationColor)
- [ ] Add React.memo to row components if needed

### Phase 3: ProjectManagement Optimization
- [ ] Analyze and break down into smaller components
- [ ] Add debouncing to filters
- [ ] Implement pagination
- [ ] Memoize expensive calculations

### Phase 4: Backend Optimizations
- [ ] Add pagination support to API endpoints
- [ ] Add proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- [ ] Implement caching headers
- [ ] Optimize N+1 queries with proper includes

### Phase 5: Advanced Optimizations
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for tables (react-window)
- [ ] Add data caching layer (React Query or SWR)
- [ ] Lazy load components with React.lazy
- [ ] Code splitting for large pages

## Performance Metrics to Monitor

### Target Performance Goals
- **Initial page load**: < 2 seconds
- **Filter response time**: < 200ms (with debouncing)
- **Table render time**: < 500ms for 100 items
- **Pagination switch**: < 100ms

### Key Metrics
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Total Blocking Time (TBT)

## Implementation Priority

1. **HIGH**: Debouncing + Pagination (immediate UX improvement)
2. **HIGH**: Memoization (reduce unnecessary re-renders)
3. **MEDIUM**: Backend pagination (reduce data transfer)
4. **MEDIUM**: Virtual scrolling (for tables with 1000+ rows)
5. **LOW**: Advanced caching (nice-to-have)

## Expected Impact

### With Debouncing + Pagination + Memoization
- **Before**: 1000 resources = 1000 DOM nodes, re-render on every keystroke
- **After**: 50 resources per page = 50 DOM nodes, render after 500ms debounce
- **Performance improvement**: ~20x faster rendering, ~95% fewer re-renders

### With Backend Pagination
- **Before**: Transfer 1000 resources (~500KB JSON)
- **After**: Transfer 50 resources (~25KB JSON)
- **Network improvement**: ~95% reduction in data transfer
