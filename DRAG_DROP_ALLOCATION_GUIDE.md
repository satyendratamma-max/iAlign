# Drag & Drop Allocation - Quick Start Guide

## üéØ Simple Workflow

Both Timeline and Kanban views now support **instant allocation** with drag-and-drop. No dialogs, no forms - just drag, drop, and done!

---

## ‚ö° How It Works

### **Automatic Defaults:**
- ‚úÖ **Duration**: Matches full project timeline
- ‚úÖ **Allocation**: 100% by default
- ‚úÖ **Type**: Shared allocation
- ‚úÖ **Skills**: Automatically matched to best capability/requirement

### **Result:**
- Instant allocation creation
- Success notification appears
- Data refreshes automatically
- Edit later if you need different values

---

## üñ±Ô∏è Timeline View Usage

### **Step-by-Step:**
1. Find a project in the **"Available Projects"** pool (bottom)
2. **Drag** the project card
3. **Drop** it on any resource row
4. ‚úÖ Done! Success message appears

### **What Happens:**
```
Project "Website Redesign" ‚Üí Dropped on "John Doe"

System automatically creates:
- Resource: John Doe
- Project: Website Redesign
- Duration: Full project (Jan 2025 - Jun 2025)
- Allocation: 100%
- Type: Shared
- Skills: Auto-matched (e.g., React Developer ‚Üí React Developer Need)
```

### **Visual Feedback:**
- Green notification = Success
- Red notification = Error (check console for details)
- Allocation bar appears immediately on timeline
- Project moves out of "Available Projects" pool

## üé¥ Kanban View Usage

### **3 Ways to Allocate:**

#### **Method 1: Resource ‚Üí Project Card**
1. Drag resource card from left
2. Drop directly on specific project card (right)
3. ‚úÖ Done!

#### **Method 2: Project ‚Üí Resource Card**
1. Drag project card from right
2. Drop directly on specific resource card (left/middle)
3. ‚úÖ Done!

#### **Method 3: Card ‚Üí Column**
1. Drag resource to "Projects Needing Resources" column
2. System picks first available project
3. ‚úÖ Done!

   OR

1. Drag project to "Available Resources" column
2. System picks first available resource
3. ‚úÖ Done!

### **Visual Feedback:**
- Green notification = Success
- Cards update immediately
- Resource moves to "Allocated Resources" column
- Project requirement counts update

## ü§ñ Automatic Skill Matching

The system intelligently matches skills:

### **Perfect Match:**
```
Resource Capability: SAP/ABAP/Developer - Expert
Project Requirement: SAP/ABAP/Developer - Expert

‚úÖ Perfect match! Auto-linked.
```

### **No Perfect Match:**
```
Resource Capability: React/TypeScript/Frontend - Senior
Project Requirement: Angular/JavaScript/Frontend - Mid

‚ö†Ô∏è No exact match
‚Üí System uses resource's PRIMARY capability
‚Üí Links to first project requirement
‚Üí You can edit manually later
```

### **No Skills Available:**
```
Resource has no capabilities OR Project has no requirements

‚Üí Allocation created without skill linkage
‚Üí Still valid, just no match score
‚Üí Add skills manually later if needed
```

## üí° Pro Tips

‚úÖ **Speed Tip:** Use Timeline View for quick visual planning, then switch to Table View for detailed review

‚úÖ **Accuracy Tip:** Check skill cards on resources/projects before dragging to ensure good matches

‚úÖ **Capacity Tip:** Watch the capacity chips - green means available, red means over-allocated
